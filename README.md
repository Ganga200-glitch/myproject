Project Description
Bee_into_hive is a completely pointless game where you try to drag bees into a hive… but they keep escaping in random numbers for no reason. There’s no winning, no score, and no reward — just pure frustration.
The Problem (that doesn't exist)

The Solution (that nobody asked for)
We created Bee_into_hive – a game where your only goal is to get all the bees into the hive.
Except…
•	Bees escape randomly just when you think you’re about to win.
•	The number of escaping bees is never predictable.
•	There is no win condition.
•	The game is a trap – like life, but with more buzzing.
